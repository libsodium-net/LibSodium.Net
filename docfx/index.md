## ðŸŒŠ First-Class Streaming Encryption

LibSodium.Net provides idiomatic support for large file and streaming authenticated encryption using libsodiumâ€™s XChaCha20-Poly1305.

Powered by the `SecretStream `API, you can securely encrypt and decrypt files of any size with tamper-detection and zero nonce reuse risk â€” all in a few lines of code.

## ðŸš€ Get Started

Install the NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package LibSodium.Net
```

Then head over to our [Guide](./guide/index.md) to learn how to:

- Encrypt and decrypt data securely
- Generate cryptographic keys
- Work with secure memory
- Handle errors properly and safely
