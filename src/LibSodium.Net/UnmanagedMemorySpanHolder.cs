	/// This class stores the pointer and length of an unmanaged memory span, allowing for its later reconstruction.
	/// It is critical to use this class only with spans pointing to unmanaged memory.
	/// Using it with managed or stack-allocated spans will result in undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.
	/// This holder is particularly useful when a span needs to be accessed in asynchronous operations,
	/// lambda expressions, anonymous methods or other contexts with limited scope, such as after awaiting a task.
	/// </remarks>
